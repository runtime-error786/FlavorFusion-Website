       "'RECIPE\\nBOOKI am delighted to welcome you to our first Meals & More recipe book. At Brakes \\nwe feel it is essential that children in the UK, whatever their circumstances have \\naccess to good food 365 days of the year. From the start of our holiday hunger \\nprogramme in 2015 we recognised that volunteers and professionals alike can give \\na good service to their communities when they have the skills and resources to do \\nso. That is why we have chosen the best of our most popular nutritionally balanced \\nand easily prepared recipes for this book.\\nWe have also been lucky enough to have wonderful contributions from some of our \\nMeals & More industry chef supporters and we hope you enjoy their recipes.\\nWe believe that everyone has a part to play in tackling child poverty and a great \\nplace to start to truly make a difference is with preparing and sharing a healthy \\nmeal.\\nI hope you will not only enjoying cooking these great recipes at your community \\nvenue but that you consider them part of the Meals & More legacy that helps to \\nend UK child hunger.\\nBest RegardsForward\\nTon ChristiaanseTon Christiaanse\\nBrakes CEO UKForward\\nTon Christiaanse\\nBrakes CEO UKForeword\\nTon Christiaanse\\nBrakes CEO UK\\nAll statistics provided by Child Poverty Action Group, June 2015Content\\nNutritional Information ....................................................... 06\\nFood Safety ................................................................................ 08\\nAllergen Information ............................................................ 10\\n Chicken Dishes ............................................................ 11\\n Beef Dishes .................................................................... 22\\n Lamb Dishes .................................................................. 28\\n Pork Dishes .................................................................... 30\\n Fish Dishes ..................................................................... 34\\n Non-Meat Dishes ......................................................... 42 \\n  Soups ..................................................................... 52\\n    W r a p s  .............................................. 56\\n    Sweet Treats .............................. 62\\n    Smoothies .................................... 78\\nFriends of Meals & More ...................... 82Nutritional\\nInformation\\nGood nutrition is essential for everyone and particularly for children. It is \\nimportant for their growth and general well-being and establishes a good \\ndiet in childhood, which helps to maintain health into adulthood. The \\nneeds of children should all be met through food eaten as regular meals \\nand snacks. Holiday clubs are therefore a great help to families trying to \\nprovide healthy food for their children, particularly those entitled to free \\nschool meals.\\nA lunch should always provide:\\nEnergy  - this is needed for growth and to maintain activity levels. It should be provided mainly from \\nstarchy carbohydrates such as bread, potatoes, rice or pasta. Try to include some wholegrain options too. \\nStarchy foods provide B vitamins as well as fibre so they are a great source of energy. Sugar also provides \\nenergy but doesn’t provide any other nutrients. Fat provides a very rich source of energy so should be \\nused sparingly.\\nProtein  - provides the building blocks for children’s growth and is found in fish, meat, eggs, beans, pulses \\nlentils, nuts and meat alternatives such as Quorn. These foods also provide other nutrients such as iron, \\nomega 3 fats (in oily fish such as salmon) zinc and some fibre from beans and pulses.Fruit and vegetables  - provide a variety of vitamins and minerals such as \\nvitamin C, folate as well as fibre. We all need at least 5 portions of fruit and \\nvegetables each day and almost all fruit and vegetables count,  including \\nfresh, frozen, canned, dried and 100% unsweetened juice. The portion size for \\njuice is 150 mls and can only be counted as 1 of your 5 a day, no matter how \\nmuch is drunk.\\nDairy  - provides protein and calcium. Calcium is essential for the \\ndevelopment and maintenance of strong bones and teeth. Dairy products \\ninclude milk, cheese and yogurt.\\nOver the whole holiday, the lunches should offer a variety of different foods to \\nensure that a good range of nutrients is provided and it may even introduce \\nchildren to new foods they’ve not experienced before.\\nHydration  - is also important, so water should be available to drink at all \\ntimes and should be encouraged if some of the activities at the club are \\nenergetic or the weather is warm. A drink should always be provided with \\nlunch and this should be either water, diluted fruit juice or a sugar free drink.\\nHolidays are a time for some treats too such as a birthday celebration, an \\nouting or at the end of holiday party. If children are included as part of the \\nmenu planning, it will help them understand when it’s appropriate to eat \\ntreats like chocolate, sweets, crisps and other high fat, salt and sugar snacks.\\nWe hope this recipe book will inspire you to make great tasting food for the \\nchildren attending your holiday club and that this food will provide a healthy \\nmeal and to establish good eating habits that will last them a lifetime.\\n07Food Safety: \\n4 Basic Principles\\n1. Cross Contamination\\n o Keep raw and cooked foods separate from each other as well as foods that contain the known \\n    allergens. For example use separate chopping boards\\n o Cover hair and wear protective clothing such as aprons to prevent you from contaminating  \\n    foods\\n o Wash fruit & vegetables/salad prior to use and service\\n2. Cleaning\\n o Wash hands every time  on commencing work, after handling raw foods, after toilet breaks and \\n             after handling any dirty packaging\\n o Working surfaces should be cleaned on regular basis – clean as you go – especially after food\\n             prep/raw & allergen related products. Use a sanitiser and clean cloths\\n3. Chilling\\n o Foods which must be kept chilled h ave a ‘use by’ date and/or instructions to  keep refrigerated.  \\n    Also remember to chill foods you have cooked to use later and ready to eat foods such as \\n    sandwiches, cooked meats and salads\\n08 o Ideally do not cook  food to be eaten later or another day. If you do, you \\n              must label with the date of cooking and it must be brought to a chill \\n              temperature quickly\\n o Chilled temperature is below 8oC\\n4. Cooking\\n o All food should be steaming hot in the centre and liquid di shes should \\n    bubble throughout when stirred. For poultry and fish, juices should run clear\\n o When serving rice, cook and serve immediately – do not reheat\\n o Follow manufacturers’ instructions If using pre-prepared food\\nKey cooking  times and temperatures – to kill bacteria cooking \\ntemperatures of food should reach\\n - 80°C  for at least 6 seconds \\n - 75°C for at least 30 seconds \\n - 70°C for at least 2 minutes \\n - 65°C for at least 10 minutes \\n - 60°C for at least 45 minutes  \\nStorage temperatures\\n - Fridge/chilled below 8oC\\n - Freezer/Frozen -18oC\\nFor safe \\nhot holding, ensure food is \\nabove 63 oC for ideally no more \\nthan an one\\nhour\\n09Food Information to Consumers regulation is a new \\nEU law covering all aspects of food labelling and \\nallergen information which has applied since 13th \\nDecember 2014.\\nThe 14 allergens are cereals containing gluten, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, \\nsoya, milk, nuts, celery, mustard, sesame, sulphur dioxide (above 10 ppm), lupin \\nand molluscs.\\nIt is quite likely you could be cooking for children with all sorts of different needs \\nor allergies so each recipe if you use the same ingredients will tell you what \\nallergens are in that recipe.\\nLook out for these icons, if they appear on the recipe it means they can \\nbe found in that dish. The ingredients highlighted in bold indicate they \\ncontain the allergen.\\nCelery\\nMolluscsCrustaceans\\nMustardEggs\\nNutsFish\\nPeanutsGluten\\nSesameLupin\\nSoyaMilk\\nSulphur\\nDioxideAllergen\\nInformation\\n10The information contained within this book is correct at the date published\\n (May 2017), but is subject to change at any time and without notice.Chicken     Dishes\\n11Chicken \\nCasserole\\nServes 10\\nIngredients\\n750g Diced Chicken\\n75g Onions\\n4g Fresh Garlic\\n50g Celery\\n140g Carrots\\n75g Swede\\n100g Unsmoked Rindless \\n Streaky Bacon\\n25g Plain Flour\\n25g Vegetable Bouill on Paste\\n (Check ingredient list for allergens)\\n1l Water\\n400g Chopped To matoes \\n (in tomato juice)\\n20g Tomato Purée\\n5g Thyme\\n40g Pearl Barley\\n50g Garden Peas\\n33ml Sunflower OilServing Tip\\nServe with a chunk \\nof crusty bread\\n12Celery GlutenGetting ready\\n1.

      "4 Basic Principles\n",
      "1. Cross Contamination\n",
      " o Keep raw and cooked foods separate from each other as well as foods that contain the known \n",
      "    allergens. For example use separate chopping boards\n",
      " o Cover hair and wear protective clothing such as aprons to prevent you from contaminating  \n",
      "    foods\n",
      " o Wash fruit & vegetables/salad prior to use and service\n",
      "2. Cleaning\n",
      "6 2. Cleaning\n",
      " o Wash hands every time  on commencing work, after handling raw foods, after toilet breaks and \n",
      "             after handling any dirty packaging\n",
      " o Working surfaces should be cleaned on regular basis – clean as you go – especially after food\n",
      "             prep/raw & allergen related products. Use a sanitiser and clean cloths\n",
      "3. Chilling\n",
      " o Foods which must be kept chilled h ave a ‘use by’ date and/or instructions to  keep refrigerated.  \n",
      "    Also remember to chill foods you have cooked to use later and ready to eat foods such as \n",
      "    sandwiches, cooked meats and salads\n",
      "08 o Ideally do not cook  food to be eaten later or another day. If you do, you \n",

      "              temperature quickly\n",
      " o Chilled temperature is below 8oC\n",
      "4. Cooking\n",

      "    bubble throughout when stirred. For poultry and fish, juices should run clear\n",
      "7 o When serving rice, cook and serve immediately – do not reheat\n",
